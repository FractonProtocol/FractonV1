# FractonV1

Fracton Protocol is an NFT liquidity infrastructure, with 2 steps of fractionalization (ERC721-ERC1155-ERC20), which provides permissionless liquidity and oracle for all kinds of NFTs. Based on a deeply reformed ERC1155 middle layer standard, Fracton is building a non-status smart contract system, to increase the protocolâ€™s efficiency, lower gas fees, and maximize asset security.

Dedicated to abstracting the financial layer apart from the utility of NFTs, Fracton can be easily integrated into both CEX and Dapps, and also offer solutions for both inter-protocol liquidity providers and fractionalized NFT market makers.
